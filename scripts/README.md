# Registry scripts

All scripts are **Python standard library only** (Python ≥ 3.10) — there is no
dependency manifest because there are no dependencies. Run them from the
repository root; each resolves `registry/` relative to the current directory
(or takes a root as its first positional argument).

`make check` runs the same verification suite as CI.

## The pipeline, in order

Importers and enrichment rewrite records; everything downstream of them is
regeneration and verification. After any step that writes records, finish the
pipeline before committing.

| Step | Script | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Import | `import_localmaxxing.py` | LocalMaxxing snapshot | candidate recipes, instances (`launch.kind: reference`) |
| 1. Import | `import_postgres_publication.py` | local.ai Postgres publication (see docs/PROVENANCE.md) | candidate recipes + speed-sweep |
| 1. Import | `import_hf_benchmarks.py` | HF Model & Benchmark Matrix scrape | `registry/benchmark/` |
| 1. Import | `import_market_snapshot.py` | local-ai-scanner-cli snapshot | `registry/price/` |
| 1. Import | `fetch_extra_prices.py` | public retailer search pages | scanner-style snapshot for the market import |
| 1. Import | `fetch_hf_downloads.py` | public Hugging Face API | `model.downloads` (30-day + all-time counts; drives the models-page sort) |
| 1. Import | `import_verified_sources.py` | LocalMaxxing / Mia Labs / mlx.fast / HF configs | candidate + validated recipes |
| 2. Tokenize | `tokenize_observed_command.py` | observed shell strings on records | `metadata.<source>.tokenized` (never the launch contract) |
| 3. Enrich | `enrich_registry.py` | records | shared enrichment contract fields (facts, provenance) |
| 3. Enrich | `enrich_localmaxxing_live.py` | paginated public LocalMaxxing leaderboard API | exact live fields on existing recipes + speed sweeps; never creates records |
| 3. Enrich | `enrich_hardware_prices.py` | fresh, exact US price observations | current hardware street/system prices, stock, availability, price history |
| 3. Enrich | `enrich_hf_metadata.py`, `enrich_hf_active_params.py`, `enrich_hf_model_lineage.py`, `enrich_benchmark_aliases.py` | public Hugging Face API/model cards | exact model metadata, active parameters, lineage, benchmark aliases |
| 3. Enrich | `fill_derived_fields.py` | already cited registry evidence | deterministic exact derivations only |
| 4. Curate | `curate_registry.py` | records | curated hardware, sanitized candidates, **`registry/index/` shards** (`--index-only` for just the index) |
| 5. Format | `format_registry.py` | every `registry/**/*.json` | canonical form: 2-space indent, sorted keys (schemas keep hand order), raw UTF-8, trailing newline |
| 6. Verify | `validate_registry.py` | records + index | nothing — referential integrity, trust boundary, index staleness |
| 6. Verify | `npm test` | records + schemas | nothing — ajv validates every record against `registry/schema/*.schema.json` |

Standalone tool: `benchmark_openai_chat.py` measures prefill/decode of a
running OpenAI-compatible endpoint (no hidden token caps) to produce
speed-sweep evidence.

## Contract notes

- **Shape rules live in the JSON Schemas** (`registry/schema/`), enforced by
  ajv in `npm test`. `validate_registry.py` covers only what schemas cannot
  express. Change the schema first, then run `npm run gen:types` — `types.ts`
  is generated output.
- Observed source commands never become launch contracts: candidate imports
  stay `launch.kind: "reference"` and tokenized argv lives in metadata
  (`tokenize_observed_command.py` docstring has the full rules).

## Promotion: candidates to cartridges

Observed candidates keep `launch.kind: reference` forever — the evidence
is never rewritten. The path to a validated, replayable recipe:

1. `synthesize_launches.py` adds a `draft_launch` to eligible candidates
   (NVIDIA vllm/sglang/llama.cpp today) — a mechanically generated,
   UNVERIFIED docker contract built from the candidate's own facts and an
   image digest already audited elsewhere in this registry.
2. On the target hardware: `local-ai validate <recipe-id>` preflights the
   machine, launches the draft, waits for health, runs a real completion
   with streaming TTFT/decode measurement (`accept_recipe.py`), pins the
   served model revision, writes an acceptance speed-sweep, and promotes:
   draft_launch becomes launch, status becomes validated.
3. Rebuild the index, run `make check`, commit, open a PR. CI re-verifies
   everything the promotion claims.

A failed acceptance changes nothing: the recipe stays a candidate.

## Validation on rented GPUs

For hardware nobody on the team owns, the same acceptance runs on a rented
box. The recipe's digest-pinned image is the container image and its
arguments are the container command, so the contract under test is the
published one; rented containers have no docker daemon, so nothing is
docker-in-docker.

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `clone_candidate.py <source> <hardware-id>` | derives a candidate for another card from a validated launch or a draft: contract copied, evidence not. `--ctx`, `--instance`, `--id` adjust it. |
| `validate_rented.py <recipe-id> [--provider vast\|runpod]` | rents the card, waits for `/v1/models`, runs `accept_recipe.py` against the box's public endpoint, promotes (`--recommend` also flags it), always destroys the box. Retries once on a host whose image pull stalls. |
| `validate_batch.sh <recipe-id>...` | runs several, logs under `../runs/`, prints PROMOTED/FAILED per recipe. `PARALLEL=N` rents N boxes at once; `PROVIDER` picks the provider. |
| `make_tabbyapi_candidate.py --repo R --branch B --model M --hardware H --ctx N` | writes the EXL3 model-instance for a branch head, a TabbyAPI config asset for the context and cache mode, and a bridge-networked candidate recipe. `--image` and `--image-provenance` pin a self-built image. |
| `recommend.py [--dry-run]` | keeps exactly one `recommended` recipe per hardware id by the V1 tier map (VRAM picks the model; TabbyAPI/SGLang ahead of llama.cpp; larger context first), never a host-networked or host-IPC recipe. |
| `export_plugin_recipes.py` | emits the file the Omarchy plugin vendors: one validated, recommended, single-GPU docker recipe per hardware id. Fails on two recommended for one card; lists cards with validated but no recommended recipe. |

Providers: **Vast.ai** (`vastai` CLI, key in `~/.config/vastai/vast_api_key`)
pulls any public registry through the host's docker and is the default.
**RunPod** (`~/.runpod/config.toml`) cannot pull from ghcr.io on community
hosts, so it only works for Docker Hub images such as vllm and sglang.

TabbyAPI recipes need weights under `<mount>/<model_name>` (the config's `model_name`); the rented run provisions that in-container and `metadata.weights_subdir` records it for the plugin.

`ipc: host` is dropped from a contract validated this way: the box ran
without it, and the Omarchy plugin refuses recipes that ask for it.

## trust.py

`status` is derived, never asserted. `python3 scripts/trust.py` lists every recipe whose stored status disagrees with the criteria in the module docstring; `--apply` rewrites them and drops `recommended` from anything that no longer qualifies. `validate_registry.py` imports the same function, so CI fails on drift. `make trust` runs apply + format.
